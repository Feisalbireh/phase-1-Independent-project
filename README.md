# All you can eat Ingredients
 
# About the Project
 
It is a Ingredients application where you can find ingredients to your favorite foods!
 
# Introduction
 
I wanted to create an application where you can search a variety of different foods and be able to see the ingredients of any one and try to make it yourself. I also wanted it to be very simple, quick and easy to use right when you load the page.
 
# Getting Started
 
In order for you to use the content on this repo ensure you have the following:
 
- A ccomputer that runs on either of the following;(Windows 7+, Linux, Mac OS)
- nodejs 9.0+
 
# Running the Live Application Link
 
To use this application live just press the link in the about section above, or you can press it here
 
               "https://frolicking-basbousa-058c91.netlify.app"
 
When the page loads you should see the title of the project and the search bar.
 
To use it
- In the search bar enter any ingredient for example: `garlic, beef, eggs, bread`
- Pick any meal you would like by pressing the Ingredients button.
- After pressing it should show you the meal name and the instructions on how it was made.
- At the bottom of the instructions there is a Watch Video Link where you can visually see how the meal is made.
